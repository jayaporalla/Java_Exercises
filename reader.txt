The quiet hum of the city at dawn carries a sense of both stillness and promise. Golden rays filter through the mist, 
touching rooftops and empty streets, as if the world itself is slowly waking from a long, gentle sleep. 
Somewhere in the distance, a bakeryâ€™s warm aroma drifts into the air, mingling with the crisp scent of morning. 
A lone cyclist glides past, their silhouette framed by the rising sun, a reminder that every day offers 
a fresh canvas waiting to be filled with stories, choices, and small moments of magic.
